- On your command line, navigate to the main directory of this project
The main directory should be: “CS4530_team_405-final-submission”
- Once you are in this directory, follow the basic same steps as would be followed for any basic npm app:
  - “npm i” 
  - “npm start”
- The webpage should open automatically once loading is done. If not, navigate to:
“localhost:3000” on your web browser of choice.
- To run tests, run “npm test” in the terminal (make sure you are still in the right directory)
